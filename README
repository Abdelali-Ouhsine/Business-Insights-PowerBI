# Power BI Business Dashboard  Project

## Project Context
I worked as a Data Analyst in a company aiming to improve decision-making through dynamic reports.  
Previously, business information was shared using static Excel files, which limited analysis, visibility, and KPI tracking.

The objective of this project is to design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** capable of:
- Centralizing and structuring data from multiple operational sources
- Enabling analysis by segments (customers, products, suppliers, locations, periods)
- Providing dynamic KPIs and visual insights to support decision-making

## Main Goals
- Build a **professional and interactive Power BI report**
- Implement a **reliable data model** using best practices (Star Schema, Date Table, Controlled Relationships)
- Translate business questions into meaningful KPIs and measures
- Use advanced Power BI features (filters, bookmarks, interactions, storytelling)
- Communicate clear and actionable insights for business decisions

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 – Data Preparation & Modeling
- Import all tables into Power BI
- Verify and correct data types (dates, numbers, text)
- Create relationships between tables using **Star Schema**
- Build a **Date Table** (Year, Month, Quarter, Day)
- Create business measures and KPIs
- Organize the data model:
  - Hide unused fields
  - Create folders (Localization, Measures, KPIs, etc.)

### Phase 2 – Core Visualizations
- Professional visual environment:
  - Consistent background
  - Welcome / Home page
  - Harmonized color theme

**Visuals Implemented**
- **Bar Chart – Top 5 Suppliers or Products**
  - Dynamic subtitle showing cumulative value
  - Automatic updates with filters and time periods

- **Line Chart**
  - KPI evolution over time (Year / Month / Quarter)
  - Trend line for performance dynamics

- **Pie / Donut Chart**
  - Activity distribution by category or segment
  - Relative contribution visualization

- **KPI Cards**
  - Display totals, volumes, delays, or key metrics
  - Fully dynamic with filters

### Phase 3 – Tables & Interactions
- Matrix and cross tables by customer, product, or supplier
- Conditional formatting:
  - Colors based on values
  - Icons for thresholds (↑ ↓ ⚠)
- Advanced filters and interactions
- Bookmarks for navigation and storytelling
- Tooltips for additional details

### Phase 4 – Data Analysis

**Without DAX**
- Standard aggregations (SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- Quick Measures
- Visual calculations

**With DAX**
- Advanced measures for:
  - Top 5 suppliers/products
  - Segment and period comparisons
  - Trend and anomaly detection
  - Volume and delay impact analysis

**Business Questions Addressed**
- Which suppliers or products perform the best?
- Which product category generates the highest activity?
- Which region or city contributes the most?
- What delays or gaps affect performance?
- Which customer segments need attention?

---

### Phase 5 – Finalization & Publication
- Report readability and consistency check
- User experience optimization (navigation, filters, colors)
- Publish to **Power BI Service**
- Document the `.pbix` file with clear naming and organized folders
- Write a short narrative report highlighting **3 key insights**
